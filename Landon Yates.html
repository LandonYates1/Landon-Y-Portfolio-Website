            Hello, my name is Landon Yates and I am originally from Illinois. I moved to Arizona a few years
            ago and I am interested in technology. I mostly did a lot of photo editing before going to college
            and I make downloadable assets for a game called osu. I also like to play videogames in my freetime.

                <p>
                    I have been photo editing for almost a year now and I have learned almost all of what the software
                    is capable of. I have been thinking recently about doing it as a part time job, when I am not busy.

                <h3>Website Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Recently I have made a website as part of my introduction to programming class.
                    This website has links to a UAT boards page as well as a link to my UAT Space page 
                    that I made in intro to programming.
